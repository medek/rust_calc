#Description

Just a little shell calculator/parser written in rust (somewhat badly).
Handles operator precedence, and a handful of functions (sin and co).
No variables or anything like that.

#FAQ

###Q. What's with all the closures?

I went nuts with them.

###Q. Why the conversion between str and String?

No idea, could probably get away with passing everything as &str just fine.
